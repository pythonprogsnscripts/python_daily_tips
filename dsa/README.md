# Graph Traversal

The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. More [info][1].

While using certain graph algorithms, you must ensure that each vertex of the graph is visited exactly once. The order in which the vertices are visited are important and may depend upon the algorithm or question that you are solving.

## Breadth First Search

There are many ways to traverse graphs. BFS is the most commonly used approach.
